## 📋 Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. **Create Render Account** (FREE)
- Go to: https://render.com
- Click "Get Started for Free"
- Sign up with GitHub (recommended) or email
- **No credit card required!**

### 2. **Connect GitHub Repository**

**Option A: If you have GitHub repo:**
- Push your code to GitHub
- In Render dashboard, click "New +"
- Select "Web Service"
- Connect your GitHub repo
- Select the `job_hunter_bot` folder

**Option B: No GitHub? Deploy directly:**
- In Render dashboard, click "New +"
- Select "Web Service"
- Choose "Deploy from Git"
- Or use Render's manual upload

### 3. **Configure Deployment**

Render will auto-detect settings from `render.yaml`, but verify:

- **Name:** `stage-alternance-finder`
- **Environment:** `Python 3`
- **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command:** `gunicorn web_dashboard:app`
- **Plan:** `Free` (select this!)

### 4. **Add Environment Variables**

In Render dashboard, add these:

```
SECRET_KEY = (auto-generated by Render)
GROQ_API_KEY = (optional - add later from https://console.groq.com)
```

### 5. **Deploy!**

- Click "Create Web Service"
- Wait 3-5 minutes for deployment
